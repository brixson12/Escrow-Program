Escrow Smart Contract
Overview
This Solidity smart contract implements a simple escrow system on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to deposit funds, imposes a time lock, and enables withdrawals only after the specified time has passed. The contract owner can withdraw all funds after the time lock, while individual depositors can withdraw their respective deposits.

Smart Contract Details
State Variables
owner: The address of the contract owner.
releaseTime: Timestamp indicating when the timelock expires.
balances: A mapping associating addresses with deposited amounts.

Events
Deposit: Triggered when a user deposits funds.
Withdrawal: Triggered when a withdrawal occurs.

Modifiers
onlyOwner: Ensures that only the contract owner can execute certain functions.
afterReleaseTime: Ensures that a function can only be executed after the specified release time.
onlyDepositor: Restricts certain functions to users who have made deposits.

Usage
Contract Deployment
Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Specify the release time during deployment.

This is allowed only after the specified release time.
Depositors:

Can withdraw their deposited funds using the withdrawAsDepositor function.

// Deploying the contract with a release time of 1 day

This is a simplified example for educational purposes.
Security considerations, error handling, and thorough testing are crucial for real-world deployments..
